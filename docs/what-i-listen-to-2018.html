I didn’t necessarily listen to their newest stuff, but I was introduced to these artists fairly recently.</p><p>One of my co-workers introduced me to <a href="https://hellohonne.com/" context="[object Object]">HONNE</a>, and I’ve been listening to their sophmore album, <a href="https://atlanti.cr/LoveMe-LoveMeNot" context="[object Object]">Love me, Love me not</a> pretty much nonstop. Mostly, I really respect the way that they write their choruses. They are all very simple and memorable, while maintaining their very respectable relaxed groove. Another similar artist that I have been obsessed with is <a href="https://www.muramasa.me/" context="[object Object]">Mura Masa</a>, who just keeps putting out great music. I’ve spent a good amount of time listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfaNV19jfUk" context="[object Object]">What if I go?</a>.
Another co-worker introduced me to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6WSTevYt4rGwm8QPKQr7dU" context="[object Object]">K.A.A.N.</a>, who has served as a lot of inspiration to my lyrics. I also really enjoy the playfulness he has in his songs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2JUs_G21BrJ0efehwGkUw" context="[object Object]">Scary Pockets</a> I found through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PomplamooseMusic" context="[object Object]">Pomplamoose Music</a>. They do funk covers of everything, and they’re always super groovy.</p><p>On the slower side, I’ve been listening to <a href="http://www.jacobcollier.com/" context="[object Object]">Jacob Collier</a> for years, and his music and chord choices are just insane. A friend introduced me to <a href="https://www.mosessumney.com/" context="[object Object]">Moses Sumney</a>, whose ethereal voice and songwriting is incredibly relaxing.</p><h2 id="what-i-listen-to-–-2018-the-shows">The Shows</h2><p>These are some of the different shows that I listen to while I walk around San Francisco, or before I sleep, or while I cook. Some of them are podcasts, and some of them are Youtube channels.</p><p>To get an idea of current events, I listen to 3 podcasts: <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator" context="[object Object]">The Indicator</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/" context="[object Object]">Planet Money</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily" context="[object Object]">The Daily</a> give a perspective on current events through the telling of short stories. It’s a very relaxed narrative that lets me focus on a few of the most important things going on. They are all a bit directed at United States current events, but occasionally cover the extra important global news. The Indicator and Planet Money focus more on economics, but I find that this kind of focus tends to give just general news descriptions: you need to understand what’s going on in the world in order to give a perspective on the economy. For the same reason, I find the <a href="https://www.economist.com/" context="[object Object]">Economist</a> to be a valuable news source, when I’m subscribed to it.</p><p>Most of the other channels I listen to are hobby/interest focused. <a href="https://www.20k.org/" context="[object Object]">Twenty-Thousand Hertz</a> is a podcast about the various sounds of the world, and it’s really fun! They talk about all kinds of different sounds, and why they are important; from the <a href="https://www.20k.org/episodes/thxdeepnote" context="[object Object]">THX Deep Note</a> to <a href="https://www.20k.org/episodes/spaceremix" context="[object Object]">Sound in Space</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ" context="[object Object]">Red Means Recording</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdcemy56JtVTrsFIOoqvV8g" context="[object Object]">Andrew Huang</a> are two Youtubers I listen to, explain about some different fun music production things.</p><p>I listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkMlOu7faDgqh4PfzbpLdg" context="[object Object]">Nerdwriter1</a> video essays that are about all sorts of random stuff, embrace my inner weeb with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIGQ1-ZhOkyZztHrFZxgq0w" context="[object Object]">Joy_Boy Theories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tekking101" context="[object Object]">Tekking101</a>, and follow sports (the San Francisco 49ers) increeeedibly loosesly via the <a href="https://www.ninersnation.com/nn-podcast" context="[object Object]">Niners Nation</a> podcast. I also spend a good amount of time listening/speaking <a href="https://www.pimsleur.com/" context="[object Object]">Pimsleur</a> courses in Korean and Mandarin Chinese.</p><h2 id="what-i-listen-to-–-2018-other-content-i-consume">Other Content I Consume</h2><p>I don’t watch tv or internet shows all that much, so this is actually most of the content I consume on a regular basis. If I were to quickly mention the things I watch, I’d say too many videos about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFp8uSYCjXOMnkUyb3CQ3Q" context="[object Object]">cooking</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kirstendirksen" context="[object Object]">building tiny houses</a>. I read the manga <a href="https://www.viz.com/my-hero-academia" context="[object Object]">My Hero Academia</a>, <a href="https://www.viz.com/we-never-learn" context="[object Object]">We Never Learn</a> and <a href="https://www.viz.com/one-piece" context="[object Object]">One Piece</a>. I also spend time browsing various <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" context="[object Object]">Hacker News</a> articles and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WQHDUYk310&amp;amp;list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ" context="[object Object]">Hot Ones</a> interviews.</p><p>But yup! This is the stuff I’ve been listening to in 2018. I’ll make another one of these next year, and we’ll see how it changes!</p></div></section></div><footer class="footer sans-serif col-12 pt4 pb4 mt4"><div class="row white p2">Made by Ben Pevsner</div><div class="row p2"><a href="https://github.com/ivebencrazy" class="white p2 o5 text-decoration-none">github</a><a href="https://ivebencrazy.bandcamp.com/" class="white p2 o5 text-decoration-none">bandcamp</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpznF0d3ky603SFPzJwtT0g" class="white p2 o5 text-decoration-none">youtube</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
