This is a much friendlier environment than other places I’ve gone, and I felt instantly at ease. There is a lot of people are hanging out here with their laptops, and there seems to be a lot of regulars here; it felt like the baristas knew everybody by name, even before they ordered . Speaking of the baristas, they were super duper nice. Very pleasant attitudes, attentive, occasionally teasing a couple the regulars they felt more comfortable with.</p><p><a href="https://static.bpev.me/images/flywheel-counter.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://static.bpev.me/images/flywheel-counter.jpg?width=750&amp;height=750&amp;fit=outside" alt="The Shop!" class="col-12 image"/></a></p><p>The music was a lighter rock/pop/reggae kind of genre: think Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bob Marley. I came earlier in the day, so it wasn’t too loud, but this place has hard walls, no acoustic panels, is quite large, and feels popular. It probably gets quite loud during peak hours.</p><h2 id="flywheel-coffee-the-coffee">The Coffee</h2><p>I had two pourovers while I was here, both with beans roasted here at Flywheel. They make their pourovers with Hario V60’s, and they were $4.00 a cup.</p><p>The first was a <a href="https://www.backyardbeans.com/blog/2017/7/23/coffee-washed-vs-natural-process" context="[object Object]">natural-processed</a> Geisha bean from Finca El Zapote, a historical farm in Guatemala. There has been quite a bit of fuss over <a href="https://blog.freshgroundroast.com/geisha-coffee-what-is-it/" context="[object Object]">Geisha</a> coffee, but I wasn’t aware of it when I came to Flywheel. Nevertheless, this coffee stands out. Just by the smell, I could already tell that this was a brighter and fruity coffee. This is definitely not your typical Guatemala Coffee. Tasting it makes that incredibly clear. It is a surely a brighter coffee, with an intense citrus and berry fruitiness. Although I usually prefer less acidic coffees I really appreciate this coffee’s zing, and it definitely stands out.</p><p><a href="https://static.bpev.me/images/flywheel-coffee.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://static.bpev.me/images/flywheel-coffee.jpg?width=750&amp;height=750&amp;fit=outside" alt="I also got a dank carrot bread cake" class="col-12 image"/></a></p><p>The second cup I had was a Sumatra bean, or specifically from Tano Batak.  This one was still quite bright and has some punch, but this one has much more body. It’s a bit more mellow, sweeter, and woodier than the Guatemala bean. It’s like if the Guatemala bean was just poured over some blackberry bramble and picked up some forest-y vibes or something. It’s got a little more complexity to my taste, but it’s not as clean or refined.</p><p>All-in-all, a fantastic experience, and probably my best first trip to a coffee shop in San Francisco. I’m definitely going back.</p><p><a href="https://static.bpev.me/images/flywheel-sign.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://static.bpev.me/images/flywheel-sign.jpg?width=750&amp;height=750&amp;fit=outside" alt="Flywheel" class="col-12 image"/></a></p></div></section></div><footer class="footer sans-serif col-12 pt4 pb4 mt4"><div class="row white p2">Made by Ben Pevsner</div><div class="row p2"><a href="https://github.com/ivebencrazy" class="white p2 o5 text-decoration-none">github</a><a href="https://ivebencrazy.bandcamp.com/" class="white p2 o5 text-decoration-none">bandcamp</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpznF0d3ky603SFPzJwtT0g" class="white p2 o5 text-decoration-none">youtube</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
