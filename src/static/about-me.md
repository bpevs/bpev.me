# Hi! I'm Ben! ðŸ‘‹

I make things. Mostly code and music. If you're familiar with my work, you likely use [Favioli](https://favioli.com), saw me on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpznF0d3ky603SFPzJwtT0g), or know me personally. So I apologize for whichever of those you have experienced.

This blog is basically a place to put random thoughts and stuff. If you haven't gotten enough of me, then feel free to poke around. I try to write stuff in a way that is readable and teaches new things. So hopefully you will learn something new.
