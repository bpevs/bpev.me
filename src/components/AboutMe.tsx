      I make things. Mostly code and music. If you're familiar with my work,
      {" "}
      you probably use <a href="https://favioli.com">Favioli</a>, saw me on{" "}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpznF0d3ky603SFPzJwtT0g">
        Youtube
      </a>, or know me personally.{" "}
      So I apologize for whichever of those you have experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is basically a place to put random thoughts and stuff. If you
      haven't gotten{" "}
      enough of me, then feel free to poke around. I try to write stuff in a way
      that{" "}
      is readable and teaches new things. So hopefully you will learn something
      new.
