# The Making of VX1: Songwriting

My ideation process generally starts with recording voice memos. I walk a few
hours every day, and I come up with a lot of my ideas during these walks. I
typically record these ideas as voice memos in a pretty unorganized way, ranging
from lyrics, to basslines, to hooks, to percussion. I combine many of these
ideas to create a cohesive song.

I have thousands of voice memos at this point, so if I really want to sit down
and "write a song", that's where I'll always start. But usually, one of these
voice memos gets stuck in my head, and inspires me to the point where I HAVE to
make that specific one into a song. I'll then scroll through some voice memos to
find other ideas that will mesh well, and try and combine them all in a sit-down
session.

For each of the session walk-throughs, I have included all the voice memos I can
find for all of those songs. Maybe it will give you insight into how each of
these songs progressed.

# The Sit-down Session

Once I find voice memos that I feel I can expand into a song, I'll sit down at a
piano or a computer to work out the ideas. Usually, my voice memos will include
the hook, or a verse, or a bassline, etc, but won't be an entire song. So I take
this time to record the core ideas, stitch them together, and then work on
"filling in the gaps". This usually means improving over a loop of the song, or
fiddling on a piano. This process generally takes multiple days (if not weeks or
months), and I continue to record other voice memos and ideas throughout.

## Piano Sessions vs Loop Sessions

I tend to figure out all my more complex chord progressions on piano, because
it's a comfort instrument for me. "Getaway" finally found its vibe when I stole
a chord progression from one of my meandering practice sessions on piano. "Sweet
Honey" was a song I completely wrote on piano before transitioning it to voice.

Setting up a simple session or building from a loop is how songs like "The
Problem", "S.U.S.", and "Pay Attention" came about; usually songs that are more
progressive and take time to build up. I also often export loops for use on
walks â€“ I'll simply play the loop over and over as I come up with lyrics.

## Lyrics

I still consider lyrics to be my weak point in songwriting. I have, however,
improved greatly. A lot of this is because I took a year where I was
consistently writing poetry WITHOUT music as a goal. I had even made a (now
defunct) website, [fridaypoetry.org](https://fridaypoetry.org)... But writing
poetry without additional challenge of music really helped me understand the
flow of words a lot more.

I think I started finding my groove with lyrics when I started to focus less on
meaning and rhyming, and focus more on the rhythmic flow of the song. I tend to
use a lot more "dirty" rhymes where it makes more sense in these. They add a lot
more variation and interest than perfect rhymes.

# Completing the Songwriting Process

I generally consider this phase of my process complete when I have the song in a
"performable" state. I want a rough chord progression or loop, lyrics, and my
main melodies. I'm not overly focused on details at this point.
