# The Process

This song first and foremost developed from the vocal lead. I came up with the
ENTIRE vocal lead from the very beginning, before I even got all the chords
right. It ended up being a very flexible melody that lasted over VERY different
arranging behind it.

From this version, that I thought "sounded like Coldplay"...

... To a kinda closer-to-the-real-thing version that finally developed when I
swiped the chord progression from another song I was writing.

### Lyrics

The last thing I finished was Lead 2 (the rap-ish thing). I am not the strongest
at lyrics, so when writing poetry like this, I usually start with the flow that
I want, and then write lyrics to match. For example, this is what I originally
put together for this song:

In the different versions of the song, you can hear this line evolve. I settled
on something, but then during mixing it just kept bothering me, so I actually
ended up sending Bill a patch to fix the phrase I didn't like:

# The Session

## Intro

The intro harmony was kind of interesting in that I didn't sing it in this key.
I had switched the key of the song, and I pitch-shifted these harmonies just to
see how that key sounded. But I ended up liking the texture and artifacting of
the pitch-shift, so I didn't bother to re-record it. It's easy to hear the
artifacting when listening to the vibrato of a single track. Alvin and the
Chipmunks lite!

## Main Pad

After the intro, we bring in the main pad and the bass. Like Pay Attention, this
song has a main pad that goes through the entire song. Also like Pay Attention,
this main pad is heavily affected.

## Bass

I wanted to sing this bassline through, in order to feel more natural, like
playing a bass guitar. The timing of this was really hard to balance with the
percussion, and I had to re-edit the whole thing a few times to get it properly
in-time. It was actualy a pain-in-the-ass bassline.

  </p>

The other issue I had with this is that it was kind of out of my range. So I
kinda abused pitch correction on the super low notes...

  </p>

For the second verse, I added a stereo track of 8va bassline doubles, which
helps fill it out even more.

  </p>
</figure>

## Percussion

The percussion for this song is also very "live". I think this is the only song
where I didn't use a drum machine at all. I just wanted it to feel a bit
subdued, and the drum machine "perfection" was just too heavy.

There was still heavy editing to fix timing issues between the percussion and
the bass. Once everything was split-up and edited, it looked something more like
this:

## Vocal Lead

The lead is pretty basic in this song. For the first verse, the lead is actually
just mono with mostly no doubles (just for very key phrases)

The 2nd vocal verse (3rd verse?), we add doubles (and more harmonies), in order
to make it feel a bit more engulfing.

## Candy

Besides the "main pad", pretty much all the other pads and ear candy in this
song is one-offs. So once you stop hearing them, they basically never come back.

And that's the last song! It's been fun writing these song walkthroughs, but I'm
glad I'm done, because it was a lot of work! I hope you learned something, and I
hope you are looking forward to the next music I release!
