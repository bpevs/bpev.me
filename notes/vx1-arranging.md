# The Making of VX1: Arranging

> This is part 2 of the process in [The Making of VX1](https://bpev.me/blog/vx1/)

For me, arranging in this album was usually in the form of an unorganized project session. If I hadn't created an Ableton Live session during the songwriting phase, I definitely will have one here. At this point, my initial starting point is generally a song over a loop or a song over midi instruments. I want to get off any acoustic piano recordings at this point, because I have less control in-the-box.

When I write electronic music, I tend to arrange and track at the same time. In this album, arranging and tracking were a bit more discreet. This is because tracking solo acappella is **VERY** tiring and time consuming. So for most of the arranging process, I sing at half-voice. I generally consider arranging "done" when I feel that I know what all the parts are, and have them all sung and tracked into my DAW.

# My Acappella Toolbox

I talk a bit about my general acappella arranging philosophy in my [previous blog post on arranging](https://bpev.me/blog/arranging-acappella-music), so I will focus specifically on a few techniques I use extensively in this album that I don't see too many people using. Note: I also go a bit more in-depth in each individual song's session walk-through. Find those from the homepage of [The Making of VX1](https://bpev.me/blog/vx1).

## Creative Vowel Usage

I use shifting vowel sounds for a lot of my pads. I often hear arrangers write these into long-spanning whole notes, but not on a shorter-note basis as a texture. One song that is almost completely built from these kinds of textures is Highwire. I use quick-shifting vowel sounds both as the basis for the bass line, but also throughout the song as different "synths":

## Vocal Instrument Layering

In this album, I generally eschew the idea of traditional vocal parts. There is no "soprano" or "tenor". I think of this album more like "instruments" that I create by grouping voices together. For example, I will often sing multiple versions of the same note with different vowel sounds in order to create one interesting sound.

A lot of this is the same way one would create a blend of coffee: **I have one sound that is the "body"** (the base that "glues" the sound together), **and combine that with other "texture" sounds**. Generally, there is something specific I'm looking to get out of each texture components.

### Example 1: Charlatan Days Pads

This Charlatan Days pad consists of three different sounds for each note.

  </p>

The components of this sound are something like this:

**The Body**

  </p>
  <figcaption>The Body</figcaption>

This is the "body" of the sound. It defines the general vibe and feel of the sound, and defines its roots. This one is an "Ah" to "Ooo" vowel transition.

**Adding some brightness**

In this particular sound, the body is a little dull, so I want to add some brightness. In this case, I really like to double with 8va whistles. They are higher-frequency sounds that can be used to add brightness and air.

**For the aftertaste**

  </p>

</figure>

This is to add some extra character after the initial impulse of the sound. If we're sticking to the coffee metaphor, I added this for the aftertaste.

### Example 2: Pay Attention Whistle-Hum

This sound is another example of how you can change the feel of a sound by adding some additional textures. At its core I wanted this line to feel a bit wistful, so a whistle makes sense. However, a whistle just felt a bit too joyful, and I wanted to make it a bit more understated. So I took another whistle track and pitched it down an octave to make it more like a weird hum to double the track. That with the hum melody that occasionally supports and occasionally counters creates the feel I as going for.

# Arranging Time Chamber

As an example of the kind of idea of how non-linear the progression of songwriting and arranging can be, I am putting together timelines of how each song developed over their creation. You can find these from the homepage of [The Making of VX1](https://bpev.mataroa.blog/blog/vx1/).

But as an example, here are a few versions of "Highwire", as it progressed:
