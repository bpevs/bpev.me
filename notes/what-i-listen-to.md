## Music

One of my co-workers introduced me to [HONNE](https://hellohonne.com/), and I've been listening to their sophmore album, [Love me, Love me not](https://atlanti.cr/LoveMe-LoveMeNot) pretty much nonstop. Mostly, I really respect the way that they write their choruses. They are all very simple and memorable, while maintaining their very respectable relaxed groove. Another similar artist that I have been obsessed with is [Mura Masa](https://www.muramasa.me/), who just keeps putting out great music. I've spent a good amount of time listening to [What if I go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfaNV19jfUk). Another co-worker introduced me to [K.A.A.N.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6WSTevYt4rGwm8QPKQr7dU), who has served as a lot of inspiration to my lyrics. I also really enjoy the playfulness he has in his songs. [Scary Pockets](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2JUs_G21BrJ0efehwGkUw) I found through [Pomplamoose Music](https://www.youtube.com/user/PomplamooseMusic). They do funk covers of everything, and they're always super groovy.

On the slower side, I've been listening to [Jacob Collier](http://www.jacobcollier.com/) for years, and his music and chord choices are just insane. A friend introduced me to [Moses Sumney](https://www.mosessumney.com/), whose ethereal voice and songwriting is incredibly relaxing.

## Shows

These are some of the different shows that I listen to while I walk around San Francisco, or before I sleep, or while I cook. Some of them are podcasts, and some of them are Youtube channels.

To get an idea of current events, I listen to 3 podcasts: [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), and [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily) give a perspective on current events through the telling of short stories. It's a very relaxed narrative that lets me focus on a few of the most important things going on. They are all a bit directed at United States current events, but occasionally cover the extra important global news. The Indicator and Planet Money focus more on economics, but I find that this kind of focus tends to give just general news descriptions: you need to understand what's going on in the world in order to give a perspective on the economy. For the same reason, I find the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/) to be a valuable news source, when I'm subscribed to it.

Most of the other channels I listen to are hobby/interest focused. [Twenty-Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org/) is a podcast about the various sounds of the world, and it's really fun! They talk about all kinds of different sounds, and why they are important; from the [THX Deep Note](https://www.20k.org/episodes/thxdeepnote) to [Sound in Space](https://www.20k.org/episodes/spaceremix). [Red Means Recording](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ) and [Andrew Huang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdcemy56JtVTrsFIOoqvV8g) are two Youtubers I listen to, explain about some different fun music production things.

I listen to [Nerdwriter1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkMlOu7faDgqh4PfzbpLdg) video essays that are about all sorts of random stuff, embrace my inner weeb with [Joy_Boy Theories](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIGQ1-ZhOkyZztHrFZxgq0w) and [Tekking101](https://www.youtube.com/user/tekking101), and follow sports (the San Francisco 49ers) increeeedibly loosesly via the [Niners Nation](https://www.ninersnation.com/nn-podcast) podcast. I also spend a good amount of time listening/speaking [Pimsleur](https://www.pimsleur.com/) courses in Korean and Mandarin Chinese.

## Other

I don't watch tv or internet shows all that much, so this is actually most of the content I consume on a regular basis. If I were to quickly mention the things I watch, I'd say too many videos about

[cooking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFp8uSYCjXOMnkUyb3CQ3Q) and [building tiny houses](https://www.youtube.com/user/kirstendirksen). I read the manga [My Hero Academia](https://www.viz.com/my-hero-academia), [We Never Learn](https://www.viz.com/we-never-learn) and [One Piece](https://www.viz.com/one-piece). I also spend time browsing various [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) articles and watching [Hot Ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WQHDUYk310&list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ) interviews.

But yup! This is the stuff I've been listening to in 2018. I'll make another one of these next year, and we'll see how it changes!
