VX1, or VOX 1, or Vocal Experiment 1, or Vocal Experience 1, is meant to be a project that puts together all of my acappella experience into one album. I've spent a great amount of time involved in different acappella projects in the past. While I think I have been able to put my signature on a lot of these, they were never "Ben's Album". VX1 is that album. It is a benchmark album for me that demonstrates where my music is right now.

While VX1 is recorded entirely from my vocals, it is not really meant to be an acappella album. I wanted to write this album acappella because that is where my expertise is, and because I feel like it's the best representation of "where my music is right now". However, I did not want a "this is acappella" mindset to limit how we process it. I didn't hesitate to modify the sound in all sorts of ways if it sounded more interesting, whether that means electronic effects or techniques. I have always treated this album as a music album that happens to be acappella.

## Influences

My songwriting has a lot of different influences, and I will point these out in my session walk-throughs, but here are a few of the artists I listened to a bit during the creation of this album: Anderson Paak, Billie Eilish, Disclosure, Berhana, Justin Timberlake, KAAN, Chance the Rapper, Ariana Grande, Moses Sumney, Calvin Harris, HONNE, Capital Cities, Daft Punk, Jacob Collier, Mac Miller, Surrija, Vulfpeck.
