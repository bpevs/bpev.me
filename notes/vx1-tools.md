# The Making of VX1: Tools

> Published on Apr 5, 2022

> This post is a part of the series
> [The Making of VX1](https://bpev.me/blog/vx1/), so read that for context.

Before I list everything I used for this album, I want to take a second to
mention that the tools I use are a "90% of the budget for the last 10% of the
results" situation. I've collected my recording tools over a number of years.
**It's not the set of tools I'd recommend if you're looking to start from
zero**. I believe I could have made this album sound very good using a more
barebones setup (this is my travel setup):

# The Necessities

## **[Shure SM57 Microphone](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm57) with [windscreen](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/a2ws)**

If I **DON'T** have a room that is treated for recording audio, I prefer any
unidirectional microphone. The pictured one here is my SM57, modded to have the
[transformer removed](https://tapeop.com/tutorials/52/sm-57-mod/) (the mod is
not important if you're buying your first microphone). The important thing about
this mic is that it is made for live performance, and is good at minimizing
background noise. This is nice because if we have less-than-ideal room
acoustics, we want limit room reverberations as much as possible.

If I **DO** have a well-treated recording space, I generally prefer a
large-diaphragm condenser mic for background vocals; they have a bit more
clarity, which is helpful when stacking dozens of simultaneous tracks. I
recommend looking at Craigslist for some used condenser mics, but if you want a
specific recommendation, I've recorded solid vocals with a
[CAD E100Sx](https://www.cadaudio.com/products/new-products/e100sx) in the past.

A **pop filter / windscreen** is something I would generally not use for
background vocals, since plosives can generally be avoided with good mic
technique. I would definitely use it with vocal percussion, since it's just
generally more difficult to avoid wind noises. I usually use a metal windscreen,
as it doesn't attenuate high frequencies quite as much. Here's a link to a
[really expensive one](https://www.stedmanusa.com/pop-filters) as an example,
but just look around and find a cheaper one online somewhere or at your local
music shop. Sometimes I'll also use one of those thicker foam windscreens if I
really want to eat a mic as well for any particular sound.

## **[Shure SE215](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/earphones/se215cl) In-Ear Monitors**

You really just need a pair of headphones you are used to, so you know what you
are listening to. Headphones like this will never be optimal, but they do a good
enough job to get most of the way there. Low-end and the space of a track will
become problems if you try to mix using headphones, though.

## **[RME Babyface Pro](https://rme-audio.com/babyface-pro-fs.html) Audio Interface**

There are a lot of other great preamp interfaces at a cheaper price-point. I'm a
big fan of
[Steinberg UR series](https://www.steinberg.net/audio-interfaces/ur-series/)
interfaces. That being said, my favorite are RME interfaces. They have clean
preamps and have always been super stable for me.

> STILL run without an external preamp, and just use an interface with clean

## **[Ableton Live 10](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/what-is-live/) Digital Audio Workstation**

Tracking and Editing acappella are fairly basic use-cases, and can be done in
pretty much any DAW in a very similar manner. In fact, for most of my past
acappella projects, I have used [Reaper DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/), as it is
more light and nimble than any other DAW I've used.

For this album I used
[Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/what-is-live/). Since I tend to
flow between an arranging and a looping view while songwriting, I do like
Ableton Live for creation purposes. It fits my flow better for that part of the
process. I've also started trying to do all of my larger projects in it
recently, just so I can have some consistency. Also, Live has a decent
quantization engine that I use for most rhythm editing on this album.

I dislike my flow in ProTools, but it's also worth checking out if you're
looking to do this kind of project. The biggest draw for that one is that most
non-electronic-music industry people I know use it, so it's likely you'd be able
to skip your exporting stage, and just send the whole project.

## **[Melodyne](https://www.celemony.com/en/melodyne/what-is-melodyne) Automatic Tuning**

Charlatan Days by itself has over 200 vocal tracks. If you think I'm going to
take the time to sing this entire album 100% in-tune without automatic pitch
correction, you are far more patient than I am. The two big players in this
space are Melodyne and [Antares Autotune](https://www.antarestech.com/). I
haven't really used Autotune much, but the impression I get from talking to
other people is that Melodyne is better for background vocals, and Autotune is
better for lead vocals (it sounds more natural, but less suited for large
amounts of voices).

In general for this album, I used Melodyne on most of the background vocals
(leaving the lead vocals dry), and Bill used autotune to tweak the lead vocals
where necessary.

# The Full Setup

![The Full Setup](https://static.bpev.me/blog/vx1-tools/the-desk.JPG)

These are all the tools I used for creating VX1. This list does NOT include the
tools that Bill used for mixing/mastering my album. I think he uses dark magics.

### Songwriting and Arranging

- **Paper, Pencil,
  [Apple Voice Memos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134),
  and [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** For note-taking
- **[Musescore](https://musescore.org/en)** For music notation and sorting out
  chords
- **[Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/)** DAW for quick rough sessions
- Any piano keyboard I could get my hands on.

## Tracking

- **[Ableton Live 10](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/what-is-live/)** DAW
- **[RME Babyface Pro](https://rme-audio.com/babyface-pro-fs.html)** Audio
  Interface
- **[Advanced Audio CM12se](https://advancedaudio.ca/collections/tube-microphones/products/cm12se)**
  Tube Microphone. I used this for the majority of my tracking.
- **[Earthworks SR314](https://earthworksaudio.com/vocal-microphones/sr314/)**
  Microphone. I used this when I really wanted to hold the mic, or I was too
  lazy to use the CM12se.
- **Old phone I soldered an 1/8in jack onto** for a few specific textures. The
  microphone on this phone actually sounded too clear, so I wired it to the
  phone's speaker instead of the microphone.
- **Acoustic panels** I made these with
  [Rigid Acoustic Fiberglass](https://www.atsacoustics.com/item--ATS-Acoustics-Rigid-Fiberglass-Board-1-inch-Case-of-12--1035.html),
  Purple Kona cotton, and a basic wood frame I through together with a hand saw,
  some screws, and a staple gun.

> Note: My room is **NOT** really optimal for listening and mixing – I treated
> it specifically for tracking voice. I have many acoustic panels around my
> room, but not a lot of extra thicc bass treatment panels. Headphones and a few
> car speakers did get me through the album well enough, since I could rely on

> [flutter echo](https://www.acousticfields.com/flutter-echo-apply-room-acoustics/)
> and other small-room problems, but are not enough for mixing/mastering

## Editing

- **[Melodyne](https://www.celemony.com/en/melodyne/what-is-melodyne)** (Editing
  Pitch)
- **[Ableton Live 11](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/what-is-live/)** (Editing
  Rhythm)
- **[Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/)** (Used for double-checking sessions have
  been exported correctly)

## Listening

- **[Shure SE215](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/earphones/se215cl)**
- **[Shure SE846](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/earphones/se846_wired) +
  [EATFL1](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/eatfl1-6) Tips** –
  These triple-flange tips are painful the first few times you use them. They
  feel like they are breaking your ears. But they sound WAY better. Also
  effective with the SE215. I just don't use them on those because they get
  nasty quickly.
- **[Sony WH1000-XM4](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b)**
  – I think these are the best consumer-facing headphones on the market. That
  being said, I did get mine on an employee discount, since I bought them while
  I was still an employee at Sony.
- **Friends' speakers and cars** – Listen to your music wherever you can

## Mixing and Mastering

Again, I did **NOT** do the mixing and mastering for VX1. But when I do that
kind of work, I do have tools I prefer. If that is interesting to you, I'll
provide a list of that stuff. I mostly just use pretty standard things, though.

- **[Fabfilter](https://www.fabfilter.com/)** EQs and Compressors
- **[Valhalla DSP](https://valhalladsp.com/)** Reverbs
- Many
  **[Ableton Live Plugins](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/compare-editions/#audio-effects)**
- **[SoundToys](https://www.soundtoys.com/)** Makes a lot of fun things
- **[Sausage Fattener](https://tailorednoise-downloads.com/SausageFattenerPurchase.php)**
  I use this sometimes on lead and bass
