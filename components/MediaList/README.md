MediaList
========

For lists that are entirely made of [`<Media />`](../Media) components, we should make an album or playlist, depending on the type of content.

This component is expected to be used in conjunction with our Media component, and should be able to be used with that, OR with its more specialize counterparts, [`<Image />`](../MediaImage), [`<Video />`](../MediaImage), or [`<Audio />`](../MediaAudio).
